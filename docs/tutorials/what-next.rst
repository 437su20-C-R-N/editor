What next?
----------

This tutorial have given a very brief look at what Numbas does.

Now you've written your first question and created your first exam, you'll probably want to dive into more advanced topics.
Here are some things you could try next:

* If you've got an idea of something you'd like to do, the :ref:`how-do-i` section probably contains an example showing you how to do it.
* Look at `the question highlights on the Numbas blog <https://www.numbas.org.uk/blog/category/question-highlights/>`_ for some inspiration.
* Start writing your own questions!

Most controls in the editor have links back to the documentation, so don't be afraid to get stuck in 

If you get stuck, `the Numbas users mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/numbas-users>`_ is a good place to ask for help.
