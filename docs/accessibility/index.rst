Accessibility
=============

Numbas should be accessible to everyone who needs to or would like to use it.

Accessibility is an important consideration during the design and development process.
We regularly test Numbas against a variety of accessibility requirements.

There are separate accessibility statements for the Numbas editor and for Numbas exams.
