Upgrading from Numbas 2.0 to 3.0
================================

Follow the instructions below, using a shell in your ``numbas_editor``
directory.

-   Get the latest code:: 

        git pull

-   Upgrade Python libraries::

        pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

-   Run the new setup script. 
    It will use your existing settings and perform the rest of the upgrade jobs.
    ::

        python first_setup.py

-   The editor now has "terms of use" and "privacy policy" pages. 
    You must edit those: ``editor/templates/terms_of_use_content.html`` and
    ``editor/templates/privacy_policy_content.html``.

-   Finally, get the latest code in your Numbas ``compiler`` directory::

      cd ../compiler
      git pull

That's it!
