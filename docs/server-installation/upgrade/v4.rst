Upgrading from Numbas 3.0 to 4.0
================================

Follow the instructions below, using a terminal in your ``numbas_editor``
directory.

-   Get the latest code:: 

        git pull

-   Upgrade Python libraries::

        pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

-   Run the setup script. 
    It will use your existing settings and perform the rest of the upgrade jobs.
    ::

        python first_setup.py

-   Edit the file `numbas/settings.py` and add the following line::

        LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/'

-   Finally, get the latest code in your Numbas ``compiler`` directory::

      cd ../compiler
      git pull

That's it!
