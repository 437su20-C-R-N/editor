Upgrading to Numbas 2.0
=======================

Upgrading to Numbas 2.0 from an earlier version is a straightforward
process, but can take a long time and disk space if you have a very
large database.

Follow the instructions below, using a shell in your ``numbas_editor``
directory.

-  Remove ``editor/templates/index.html`` - Numbas 2.0 looks for your
   custom welcome message in ``editor/templates/index_message.html``.

-  Get the latest code::
  
    git pull

-  Upgrade Python libraries::
   
    pip install --upgrade -r numbas/requirements.pip``

-  Migrate the database (this could take a while)::

    python manage.py migrate

-  Copy ``editor/templates/index_message.html.dist`` to
   ``editor/templates/index_message.html``, and customise to your
   liking.

That's it!

If you have any problems, email numbas@ncl.ac.uk.
