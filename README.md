**Numbas** is an open-source system for creating SCORM-compliant exams which
run entirely in the browser, developed by [Newcastle University's School of
Maths and Stats](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/).

This repository is an editor for creating Numbas exams.

Instructions for installation can be found at http://numbas.github.io/editor/.
Note that a full installation like this is not necessary if you just want to
try out the editor - you can use [the free public editor at **math**centre](http://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk).
