**Numbas** is an open-source system for creating SCORM-compliant exams which
run entirely in the browser, developed by [Newcastle University's School of
Maths and Stats](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/).

This repository is an editor for creating Numbas exams.

Instructions for installation on a Linux server (so that the editor can be
used by multiple people) can be found at http://numbas.github.com/editor/.
Note that a full installation like this is not necessary if you just want to
try out the editor on your personal desktop or laptop computer.
